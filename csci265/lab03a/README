Readme: lab03a

In this repository you will find a shell script named
   tempConv.sh, which defines function tempConv

The purpose of the function is to convert between celsius and fahrenheit,
   where the user supplies a temperature and the scale used, and the
   function computes and displays the temperature in the other scale.
E.g. to convert 100 degrees fahrenheit to the equivalent in celsius:
   tempConv 100 f

To load the script, use the command
   source tempConv.sh
You can then call the function directly from the linux command line, e.g.
   tempConv 212 C

For today's lab, you will be adding robust error checking
   to the function - currently it has no error checking at all.

The error checking you add should at least include:
  - making sure the correct number of command line arguments are provided
  - making sure the temperature is an integer (positive or negative)
  - making sure the scale provided is one of F, f, C, or c

Informative, appropriate error messages should be provided to the user
if an error is detected, and the function can then end.

Note that after each change to the script you need to re-run the
   source tempConv.sh
to load the new changes and allow you to test them.

I **STRONGLY** recommend you add one element of error checking at a time,
testing and committing after each new improvement is added, thus ensuring
that after each commit you still have a functional script.  Marks will be
given for each incremental improvement, but there will be heavy deductions
if the script doesn't work at all.
