Quiz 2a readme

The objective of this week's quiz is to work with some of the
most core aspects of version control: branching, merging, and
resolving merge conflicts.

Having successfully forked/cloned this repository (otherwise you
wouldn't be reading this!), use the ls command to see the files
in the repository.

Instructions:

1. Create a new branch of this repository, named Experiment.

2. Use the appropriate git command to checkout the new branch.

3. Edit the ThingsToDo file to include the sentence
   "Gotta add a test plan soon"

4. Use the appropriate git commands to add the revised file
   and commit (with message "added test plan to TTD").

5. Use the appropriate git command to checkout the master branch.

6. Edit the ThingsToDo file to include the sentence
   "Gotta finish the specifications right away"

7. Use the appropriate git commands to add the revised file
   and commit (with message "added test plan to TTD").

8. Use the appropriate git command to checkout the Experiment branch.

9. Run the following command to try a merge between the two branches:

       git merge master

   This should result in a conflict because of the different changes
   in the two versions of the ThingsToDo file.  Resolve the conflict
   to keep both changes (but get rid of the extra text git added to
   highlight the conflict).

10. Check out what the results look like in gitk, then perform
    your final add, commit, and push to the central repository.
