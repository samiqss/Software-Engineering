Lab 8
=====
Lab 8 is a take-home exercise, to be made available Friday November 3rd
(for both sections) and due at 4pm Friday November 10th (also for both
sections).

Overview:
---------
The objective in this lab is to complete the implementation of two perl
functions, buildContactList and buildReverseList, in file lab08.pl.
Skeletal versions of the two functions are provided in that file,
along with detailed specifications on the two functions and the
data structures they are supposed to manipulate.

The lab08.pl includes implementations of two additional functions,
validEmail and validPhone, which should be used to test the validity
of supplied email addresses and phone numbers.

Infrastructure:
---------------
Other scripts must be able to 'require' your lab08.pl file so they
can call the two functions when needed.  As such:

  (i) your lab08.pl file must end with the following line:
      1;

  (ii) your lab08.pl file should not include anything other than
       the specified function implementations - i.e. any test cases,
       calls, etc. must be done from other scripts (like the tester.pl
       script described below).

A test script, tester.pl, is supplied, and can be run to provide a
very basic test of your two functions.  Feel free to create more
advanced test scripts based on tester.pl, but it might be wise
to leave the original tester.pl unmodified to ensure your functions
still work with it.

Grading
-------
The lab grading will be based only on your lab08.pl file, and will
be carried out by a script similar to tester.pl (though with a more
thorough set of test cases).  If your two functions do not conform to
the specifications, or if they require special additional constraints
on the testing script, then they will likely do poorly in grading.
