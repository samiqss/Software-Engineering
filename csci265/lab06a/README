Lab 6 (lab06a, lab06b)
----------------------

This lab focuses on researching various topics and
applying the knowledge gained, primarily concentrating
on the C++ standard libraries, but also including some
bash and makefile material.

Part 1
------
Answer each of the following questions in the included lab6.txt file.
An excellent resource site for the C++ questions is
   cplusplus.com/reference

(1) What are the names of the C++ libraries and constants that:
    (a) give the precision of a 'double'
    (b) identify the largest random number that can be
        generated through the rand() function call.

(2) What are the names of the C++ libraries that provide/support:
    (a) regular expressions on C-style strings (arrays of char)
    (b) "wide" characters - chars beyond the usual ascii set
        (such as unicode)
    (c) the base exception class used specifically for run-time exceptions.

(3) What are the names of the C++ libraries and functions that provide:
    (a) a generic swap function
    (b) a generic quicksort function.

Part 2
------
Write a short C++ program in lab6.cpp that demonstrates the use of at least
four of the elements from questions (1)-(3) above.

Part 3
------
Write a makefile that builds your program from part 3, and that
also includes a target named 'submit' that performs a git add,
commit, and push of your lab solutions.

Part 4
------
Research the linux -x +x -X and -Y options for the ssh command,
and conduct an experiment to see if any of them can be used to
resolve the X11-related error messages students have experienced
with the "ssh csci" commands during our various git exercises.
