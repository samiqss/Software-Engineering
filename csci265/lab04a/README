# lab04a readme

# task: to create a script named searchTrash.sh
#       that allows the user to check the trash and see if
#       it contains any of their material from a specified
#       course and repository
#
# usage:
#    the user is able to enter the command
#        ./searchTrash.sh courseId assignmentName
#    e.g. to search for course csci200 the user would enter
#        ./searchTrash.sh csci200 lab1
#
# behaviour:
#    the script will then perform the appropriate commands to
#        get a list of what they have in the trash and pipe that
#        through grep for both the specified course and then
#        the specified repository
#    e.g. for csci200 lab1 it would display the results of
#        ssh csci D list-trash | grep csci200 | grep lab1
#
# exception handling:
#    if an incorrect number of command line arguments is provided
#       a suitable error message is displayed and the script ends
#    the command must be run from the core directory for the course,
#       e.g. ~/csci200 in the example above, otherwise the script
#       should generate an error message and terminate
#
# NOTES/TESTING AIDS:
# -------------------
#    if you want to experiment with your script, there is an extra csci265
#       repository posted that you can attempt forking/cloning: trashExpt
#    remember you can move something from your central repo to the trash with:
#       ssh csci D trash csci265/$user/trashExpt
#       (or whatever repository you actually trashed)
#
