CPU ANALYSIS
Not able to To analyze the cpu use, for each run of each program use gprof because I keep getting a segmentation fault for every graph or graph_gprof run.

/graph test1000

Segmentation fault

MEMORY ANALYSIS
Not able to do memory analysis, because memory allocation fails.

valgrind --tool=massif --stacks=yes --time-unit=B ./graph_valgrind < test1000

valgrind: mmap(0x60b000, 67141632) failed in UME with error 12 (Cannot allocate memory).
