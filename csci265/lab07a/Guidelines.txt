Bug Reporting Guidelines
------------------------
These guidelines are modified from the Bugzilla Bug Writing Guidelines:
    landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-5.0-branch/page.cgi?=bug-writing.html
The modifications have primarily been made to ensure suitability with
    the current lab exercise.

Principles
----------
 - Be precise
 - Be clear - explain it so others can reproduce the bug
 - One bug per report
 - No bug is too trivial to report - small bugs may hide big bugs
 - Clearly separate fact from speculation

Reporting a new bug
-------------------
(treat this bug as new and unreported for the sake of this lab)

If you can reproduce the bug in a recent build and no-one else appears to
have reported it, then report the following:

OS: On which operating system did you find it?

Summary: How would you describe the bug, in approximately 60 characters or fewer?
   A good summary should quickly and uniquely identify a bug report.
   It should explain the problem, not your suggested solution.
      Good:  "Cancelling a File Copy dialog crashes File Manager"
      Bad:   "Software crashes"
      Bad:   "Browser should work with my web site"

Description: The details of your problem report, including:

   Overview: More detailed restatement of summary.

   Steps to Reproduce: Minimized, easy-to-follow steps that will trigger the bug.
      Include any special setup steps.

   Actual Results:  What the application did after performing the above steps.

   Expected Results:  What the application should have done, were the bug not present.

   Build Date & Platform: Date and hareware of the build in which you first
      encountered the bug, e.g. Built 2017-10-30 on Debian 9.2 (Stretch)
      Note: you can look up information on our platform using the command
         lsb_release -a

   Additional Information:  Any other useful information.
