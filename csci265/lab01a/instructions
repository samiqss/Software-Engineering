lab1 instructions

---------- Part 1: basics ---------------------------------------------

 - login to your linux account

 - open a browser (Applications --> Internet --> Chrome or Firefox)
   and go to url
       csci.viu.ca/~wesselsd/courses/csci265
   then navigate to the labs page and the lab 1 quiz page

 - open a terminal window (Applications --> System Tools --> MateTerminal)

---------- Part 2: today only -----------------------------------------

 - if you have not previously done so, use mkdir to create a directory
   (here in your home directory) for your course material,
   naming the directory csci265

---------- Part 3: getting the lab repository -------------------------

 - follow the instructions on the quiz1 web page to fork/clone lab01a

 - use cd appropriately to move into the newly created repository

 - type ls, make sure the repository contains the "instructions" file,
   if not, follow the website instructions to clear your central repository
   and local directory and try Part 3 again

---------- Part 4: some linux and an add/commit/push ------------------

 - run the commands as follows to store the output in a new lab1.txt file,
   being careful to use > and >> exactly as shown

      pwd > lab1.txt
      ls -alF >> lab1.txt
      date >> lab1.txt

 - run the appropriate git commands to add lab1.txt to the repository tracking,
   commit the change, with the commit message "part 1 complete", and push
   the changes to the central repository

---------- Part 5: more linux and an add/commit/push ------------------

 - use the cp command to make a copy of lab1.txt,
   naming the new file lab1.bak (in the same directory as lab1.txt)

 - run the commands below, again being careful to use >> exactly as shown
      ls -alF >> lab1.txt
      git status >> lab1.stat

 - perform an appropriate git add, commit (with message "part 2 complete")
   and push the changes to the central repository

---------- Part 6: final linux and an add/commit/push ------------------

 - edit the readme file (preferably with vim or emacs),
   changing the top line to contain your name

 - perform an appropriate git add, commit (with message "part 3 complete")
   and push the changes to the central repository

 - logout (under the System menu)
